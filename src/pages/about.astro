        Hello! I'm Alex, a passionate musician and educator with over 15 years of
        experience playing and teaching a variety of instruments. My journey in
        music began with the piano at age six, and I haven't stopped learning
        since.
        </p>
        <p>
        My teaching philosophy is centered on making music fun and accessible. I
        believe that anyone can learn to play an instrument with the right
        guidance and a little bit of practice. I tailor each lesson to the
        student's individual interests and learning style, whether you're
        interested in classical, jazz, rock, or pop.
        </p>
        <p>
        My home studio is a comfortable and encouraging environment, equipped
        with everything we need to start your musical journey.
